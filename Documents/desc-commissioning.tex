\title{DESC Commissioning Technical Note}
\author{Your friendly friends in DESC}
\date{\today}


\begin{abstract}
  In this DESC note we suggest survey fields and tests that the
  commissioning team can employ during both the ComCam and LSST Camera
  commissioning periods.  These fields and tests will cover a range of
  times of year and will supply important test data to validate that
  all of our science goals are being met.  They will be tied to the
  LSST system requirements as enumerated in the project JIRA system. This is a test.
